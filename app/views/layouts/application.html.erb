          This app pulls track plays from
          <strong class="morning-show">The Morning Show</strong> on
          <strong><a href="https://www.kexp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="kexp-link">KEXP</a></strong>,
          archiving every play since January 2015 in a database,
          and showing recent plays plus Top lists by time period.

          I’m from Seattle, and KEXP has always been part of home for me.
          The Morning Show<em> hosted by John Richards</em> was what I had on during my morning rush-hour commute — not just background noise, but a way to wake up with the city and deal with Seattle's terrible traffic on I-5.
          And every Friday, hearing <strong>Mint Royale’s "Show Me (with Pos from De La Soul)"</strong> became something I looked forward to, a little tradition that stuck with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is my way of keeping that connection alive.
          It’s not just a technical build — it’s a way to hold onto the music and memories that shaped my everyday life living in Seattle.
        </p>
