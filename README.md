# JITMtracks

JITMtracks is a Rails app that archives and displays playlists from **The Morning Show** on [KEXP](https://www.kexp.org/).  
It pulls track plays directly from the KEXP API, storing them locally so you can browse recent plays, explore historical data, and view Top 40 charts across different time ranges.

The database currently covers **every Morning Show play since January 2015**, giving you over a decade of music history to explore.
